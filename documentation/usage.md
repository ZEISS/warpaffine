## Explanation of the parameters

* The following options are mandatory and must be given on the command line:
  * `-s,--source SOURCE_FILE`
  * `-d,--destination DESTINATION_FILE`  

  The filenames must be given including the file-extension (usually `.czi`). For the destination file, there is a special value `nul` which instructs to discard the processed data. 
  This is useful for testing.

* The argument `-o,--operation MODE_OF_OPERATION` specifies the transformation which is to be applied to the source document.
  The following values are possible:
  * **Identify**: The identity transformation, which is a dummy operation which does not change the data. Useful for testing.
  * **Deskew**: a shearing transformation is applied. The operation is depicted here:
    ![shear_transformation](assets/shear_transformation.PNG)
  * **CoverGlassTransform**: the shearing transformation is followed by a rotation around the x-axis so that the stack lines up with the X-Z-plane.
    So, the result of Deskew is then further transformed by a rotation around the x-axis, as depicted here:
    ![shear_transformation](assets/coverglass_transformation.PNG)
  * **CoverGlassTransform_and_xy_rotated**: the transformation (of CoverGlassTransform) is followed by a rotation aound the z-axis (by 90Â°).
  
  Conceptually, the input document is transformed as described here, and the resulting volumetric dataset is then sampled in a Cartesian coordinate system.
* The argument `-i,--interpolation INTERPOLATION` instructs which interpolation is to be used (when resampling the transformed volume). Note that
   not all interpolation methods are available for all warp-engines. 
* With the argument `-r,--reader READER_IMPLEMENTATION` different implementations of [libCZI::IStream](https://zeiss.github.io/libczi/classlib_c_z_i_1_1_i_stream.html) interface can be chosen. This component
  is responsible for actually reading the data from the file. There is an experimental implementation leveraging [memory-mapped files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/io/memory-mapped-files) (on Windows only).
* `-b,--bricksource BRICK_READER_IMPLEMENTATION` allows to chose between different implementations of the [ICziBrickReader](../libwarpaffine/brickreader/IBrickReader.h)-interface.
  The most stable implementation is `planereader2`, and it is therefore the recommended one (and it is the default).
* `-t,--number_of_reader_threads NUMBER_OF_READER_THREADS` is used to give a parameter to the brick-reader - the number of threads which are used to read the data. '1' is the default value, and it is found that it has little impact on performance in general.
* Different implementation of the warp-affine transformation can be chosen with the argument `-w,--warp_engine WARP_ENGINE_IMPLEMENTATION`. The IPP-based
  implementation is only available if the application is compiled with the IPP library. The reference implementation is always available.
* The option `--stop_pipeline_after STOP_AFTER_OPERATION` is intended to be used for testing/benchmarking, and allows to discard the data at certain points in the pipeline.
* With the option `-c,--compression_options COMPRESSION_OPTIONS` the zstd-compression parameters (for the output file) can be specified. The syntax is as described [here](https://zeiss.github.io/libczi/classlib_c_z_i_1_1_utils.html#a4cb9b660d182e59a218f58d42bd04025).
  The default (if this option is not given) is `zstd1:ExplicitLevel=1;PreProcess=HiLoByteUnpack`.
* The flag `--hash-result` instructs to calculate a hash for the result data. This hash is then printed to the console when the operation has completed.
  Technically,  a MD5-hash is calculated for the (result) image data **and** for the respective plane-coordinates of the subblocks. The individual hashes are then combined in
  a way that the result is independent of the order in which the subblocks are processed. So, the same hash guarantees that the resulting document has the same image content.
* The application checks the size of machines main-memory and tries to adjust to the available RAM. With the option `--override-memory-size RAM-SIZE` a specific value can be
  given instead, and the applicattion will adapt its behavior accordingly. The size can be given with a suffix (e.g. `--override-memory-size 2G`).
* The argument `--verbosity` can be used to control how much output the application is writing to `stdout`. With the value `normal` information about the document and the operation is written out
  before operation begins, and during operation statistics about the on-going operation is shown. This statistics is only printed if `stdout`is a terminal, if it is re-directed to a e.g. file, it is
  not printed. With the value `minimal` there will be no informational text, the only output is then progress information (lines with the text e.g. '34.4%'). Additional lines will be printed if
  when there is a change in progress.
* The source document is examined whether it is suitable to be processed by the application. If it is not, the application will exit with an error. One of those checks is
  examining the XML-metadata of the document, in order to determine that the document is tagged as containing a skewed z-stack. This check can be
  overwritten with the flag `--override-check-for-skewed-source`.
* The option `--use-acquisition-tiles` can be used to add metadata to all sub-blocks which allows to identify which of them belong to the same contiguous 2d area. This information can be 
  used to differentiate between sub-blocks that need to be stitched (because they were acquired at different times and positions) and those that were only split for technical reasons but should
  be treated as one.
* The option `--do_not_write-stagepositions` controls whether information containing the stage-positions of the sub-blocks is written to the sub-block-metadata on output. Currently, this information
  is just copied from the input document, and it may be inconsistent in some cases. If this option is given, then the stage-positions are not written to the output document. 
 
The exit code of the application is 0 (EXIT_SUCCESS) only if it ran to completion without any errors. In case of an error (of any kind) it will be <>0.  
In case of circumstances which lead to an abnormal termination, information may be written to `stderr` (and this is not controlled by the `--verbosity` argument); output to `stderr` will
occur unconditionally.
 

## Examples

For basic operation, giving the following parameters is recommended:

```
--operation CoverGlassTransform_and_xy_rotated --interpolation Linear
```

For builds where IPP is available, the IPP-based warp-enigne will be selected by default (if it is not explicitly given). If it is not avaible, then the reference implementation is used.

So, a complete commandine for a basic operation could look like this:

```
./warpaffine --source source_document.czi --destination destination_document.czi --interpolation linear --operation CoverGlassTransform --use-acquisition-tiles
```
